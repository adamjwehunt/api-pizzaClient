A standalone Rails api to serve Orders to this Pizza Client: http://107.170.74.97:8090/

• Repo: https://github.com/ajwehunt/pizzaClient

• This is my first experience with Ruby on Rails

• Includes tests as well as the ability to Put and Delete, which will soon be added to the Pizza Client

• Heroku Server sleeps: I just learned about Dyno Hours. If the Heroku app is idle for 30+ minutes- the app sleeps. When a user logs on, there is a short delay for the data to be retrieved. So it might take a few seconds for the Orders to pop up. More info here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours
